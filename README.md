# DOOM Eternal Asset Extractor (SAMUEL) v2.1.2

SAMUEL is a tool for extracting assets from DOOM Eternal. 

It is cross-platform, open-source, and features an easy-to-use graphical interface.

## What this tool is for:

1. Export .decl files and .entities files.
2. Export full-size images for use in texture modding (in .png format).
3. Export .lwo and .md6mesh files to the .obj file format.

m_files will be extracted to the "exports" folder. Models will be extracted to the "modelExports" folder. When exporting a model, all of the model's textures and material2 .decl files will also be exported.

## SAMUEL vs. VEGA

This will obviously get compared to VEGA (the other asset extraction tool), so its probably necessary to explain the differences here:

### Differences from VEGA:

1. SAMUEL is cross-platform and open-source. It works on Windows and Linux.
2. Supports extracting of .decl files and .entities files.
3. When exporting a model, all of it's material2 .decl files are also exported.
4. Successfully extracts a few types of textures that VEGA doesn't support.
5. Supports extracting non-streamed or modded textures - texture modders can now recover their source images.
6. Has improved search functionality - can search with multiple keywords separated by spaces.
7. Image files are exported using their full name with "$" modifiers (important for custom assets).
8. m_files are extracted to their full path used in the game (e.g. "gameresources_patch1/art/tile/etc" instead of just "images").

## Building from Source:

There is no need to build/compile this program from source code. Simply download and use the included binaries for Windows or Linux (under "Releases").

If you *want* to build/compile from source, you will need a copy of the [Qt development library](https://www.qt.io/). The SAMUEL program uses Qt for its cross-platform GUI features. Please note that usage of Qt is subject to a separate licensing agreement. SAMUEL uses Qt under the [Qt for Open-Source Development](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source). The Qt source code can be acquired here: https://www.qt.io/offline-installers.

SAMUEL for Windows is tested and compiled using a static build of Qt version 6.1.2.
