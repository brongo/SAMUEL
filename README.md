# SAMUEL v1.1+ (Dev Branch)

SAMUEL is a tool for extracting assets from DOOM Eternal. 

It is cross-platform, open-source, and features an easy-to-use graphical interface.

## What this tool is for:

1. Export .decl files and .entities files.
2. Export full-size images for use in texture modding (in .dds format).
3. **Experimental:** export .lwo and .md6mesh files in their native formats (to allow for eventual reverse-engineering).

Files will be extracted to the "exports" folder, which is in the same location as SAMUEL.exe.

## SAMUEL vs. VEGA

This will obviously get compared to VEGA (the other asset extraction tool), so its probably necessary to explain the differences here:

### Differences from VEGA:

1. SAMUEL is cross-platform and open-source. It works on Windows, Linux, MacOS.
2. Supports extracting of .decl files and .entities files.
3. Successfully extracts a few types of textures that VEGA doesn't support.
4. Supports extracting non-streamed or modded textures - texture modders can now recover their source images.
5. Has improved search functionality - can search with multiple keywords separated by spaces.
6. Extracts "normals" in RG format (yellow-greenish color) used by DOOM Eternal, which should reduce steps needed to modify them.
7. Image files are exported using their full name with "$" modifiers (important for custom assets).
8. Files are extracted to their full path used in the game (e.g. "gameresources_patch1/art/tile/etc" instead of just "images").

### Limitations:

SAMUEL exports images in .DDS format only.

SAMUEL is not yet capable of exporting models (.lwo/.md6 files) for use in Substance Painter or Blender. However, it is now possible to export these files in their *native* formats for the very first time. This is an important step and it makes it possible for us to start reverse-engineering the format. Once the model format is better understood, we can add export to .obj/.fbx features.

*Texture modders will generally prefer VEGA until we can replicate this feature.*

## Building from Source:

There is no need to build/compile this program from source code. Simply download and use the included binaries for Windows or Linux (under "Releases").

If you *want* to build/compile from source, you will need a copy of the [Qt development library](https://www.qt.io/). The SAMUEL program uses Qt for its cross-platform GUI features. Please note that usage of Qt is subject to a separate licensing agreement. SAMUEL uses Qt under the [Qt for Open-Source Development](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source). The Qt source code can be acquired here: https://www.qt.io/offline-installers.

SAMUEL for Windows is tested and compiled using a static build of Qt version 6.1.2.
